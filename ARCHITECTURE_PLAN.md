# CertTracker - Certification Management System Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

CertTracker is a comprehensive web application designed to solve critical certification management challenges for a medium-sized engineering team (20-100 engineers). The system addresses certification visibility, vendor partnership compliance, expiration tracking, bonus management, competency assessment, and career planning.

## Business Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **No Centralized Certification Visibility**: Cannot efficiently identify engineers with specific certifications for project staffing
- **Vendor Requirement Compliance Challenges**: Difficulty mapping team certifications against vendor partnership requirements
- **Manual Expiration Tracking**: Certifications expire unnoticed, causing compliance issues
- **Inconsistent Bonus Implementation**: Lack of systematic tracking for certification bonus programs
- **Unclear Competency Measurement**: No defined thresholds for objective competency assessment
- **Career Progression Obstacles**: Engineers lack visibility into certification paths aligned with career goals

### Success Metrics
- 100% of team certifications tracked within 30 days
- Reduce expired certifications by 90%
- Maintain 100% vendor partnership requirements compliance
- Automate 100% of bonus-eligible certification tracking
- 80% of engineers actively using career planning features

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Material-UI** or **Ant Design** for rich UI components
- **D3.js** for tree visualization of certification paths
- **React Virtual** for efficient large data rendering

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js and TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data relationships and reporting capabilities
- **Redis** for caching search results and session management
- **Bull Queue** for background job processing (alerts, reports)

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT-based authentication** with refresh tokens
- **Role-based access control** (Engineer, Manager, Admin)
- **Data encryption** for sensitive certification information
- **Audit logging** for compliance tracking

### Integrations
- **Microsoft Teams API** for team notifications
- **SendGrid/AWS SES** for email delivery
- **AWS S3** for certificate file storage
- **Webhook support** for external system integration

# üìß Certification Expiration Email Reminder System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive **Certification Expiration Email Reminder System** for the CertTracker application. This intelligent notification system automatically sends certification renewal reminders to users based on their certification expiration dates, with multiple urgency levels and rich HTML email templates.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Tier Reminder Scheduling**
- **1-year certifications**: Reminders at 90, 60, 30, 14, 7, and 1 days before expiration
- **2-year certifications**: Reminders at 180, 120, 60, 30, 14, 7, and 1 days before expiration  
- **3-year certifications**: Reminders at 270, 180, 90, 60, 30, 14, 7, and 1 days before expiration

### 2. **Urgency-Based Email Templates**
- **Planning** (270-181 days): Early awareness and planning

- **Action** (90-31 days): Active study and scheduling
- **Urgent** (30-8 days): Immediate action required
- **Critical** (7-1 days): Last chance warnings
- **Expired** (0+ days): Post-expiration notifications

### 3. **Rich HTML Email Templates**
- Professional design with vendor-specific branding
- Renewal URL integration for major vendors (AWS, Microsoft, Google, etc.)

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Smart Scheduling Algorithm
```typescript
// Intelligent reminder scheduling based on certification validity
const schedules = {
  12: [90, 60, 30, 14, 7, 1],      // 1-year certs
  24: [180, 120, 60, 30, 14, 7, 1], // 2-year certs  
  36: [270, 180, 90, 60, 30, 14, 7, 1] // 3-year certs
};
```

### Vendor-Specific Integration
```typescript
// Automatic renewal URL generation for major vendors
const renewalUrls = {
  'AWS': 'https://aws.amazon.com/certification/recertification/',
  'Microsoft': 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/renew-your-microsoft-certification',
  'Google': 'https://cloud.google.com/certification/recertification',
  // ... more vendors
};
```

### Template Customization
```typescript
// Dynamic email templates based on urgency level
const templates = {
  planning: 'early-planning-template.html',
  preparation: 'study-preparation-template.html', 
  action: 'active-renewal-template.html',
  urgent: 'urgent-action-template.html',
  critical: 'critical-warning-template.html',
  expired: 'post-expiration-template.html'
};
```
